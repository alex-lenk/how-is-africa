                    While living in cities across East Africa, meeting fascinating people, making friends, breaking
                    bread and finding new colleagues, many entrusted me with their unique stories. They could have been
                    inspiring TedX Talks about life, courage, joy and unexpected perspectives. Those cities were boiling
                    with vibrant energy, exciting lifestyles and urban cultures. Yet, in the media world, those
                    narratives are overshadowed by accounts of social unrest and political turmoils. For years, I was
                    bombarded with one question: “How is Africa?” The gap between what I saw and what many imagined
                    Africa to be was so striking that I realised it was time to act. I brought passionate individuals
                    together to tell stories from African cities, offer tools to young people to tell theirs and bring
                    harmony to all these different voices together in one single platform. Karibu, as they say in
                    Swahili! Welcome.
